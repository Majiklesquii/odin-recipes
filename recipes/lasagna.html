    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>2 cans chopped tomatoes</li>
          <li>4 cloves chopped garlic</li>
          <li>2 grated carrots</li>
          <li>2 diced white onions</li>
          <li>1kg beef mince</li>
          <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
          <li>1 glass red wine</li>
          <li>150ml beef stock</li>
          <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>12 lasagna sheets</li>
          <li>75g mature cheddar</li>
          <li>50g butter</li>
          <li>50g flour</li>
          <li>750ml warm milk</li>
          <li>50g parmigiano reggiano</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6</li>
          <li>Heat a large frying pan with 2tbsp of the olive oil. Fry the onions until starting to soften, then add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add meat to the pan and cook until browned all over. Fry off the tomato puree, but be careful as it burns quickly.</li>
          <li>Add stock and chopped tomatoes to the pan, and bring to the boil. Simmer for around 40 minutes until meat is tender. Season with salt and pepper</li>
          <li>Towards the end of the simmer, melt butter in a saucepan. Add sifted flour and cook for one minute until flour smells nutty. Gradually whisk in warm milk, taking care not to burn flour or milk at the bottom of the pan. Continue whisking until sauce is slightly more watery than desired. Whisk in parmegiano cheese, until desired consistency. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Add thin layer of meat sauce to lasagna dish, then a thin layer of white sauce, and cover with one layer of lasagna sheets. Repeat this process until run out of pasta sheets, saving one layer of each sauce to top. Sprinkle cheddar cheese over the top.</li>
          <li>Cook for 45 minutes, until pasta is soft.</li>
      </ol>
